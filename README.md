# Estimating-pH-of-Solutions-Using-pH-Indicators-and-Absorbance-Spectroscopy
This repo contains code and resources for estimating pH of solutions via pH indicators and absorbance spectroscopy. Solutions are mixed with indicators, resulting in measured absorbance spectra. Using 2 relative absorbance calculations and 1 calibration measurement, the unknown pH of a solution can be determined.
